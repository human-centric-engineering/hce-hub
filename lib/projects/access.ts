/**
 * Project membership authorization.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "can this user reach this project?". Every
 * project-scoped read/write, page loader, and Hub capability gates through
 * `canAccessProject` / the funnel helpers here rather than hand-rolling a
 * membership check — an ad-hoc check is how enumeration and data-leak bugs get
 * in. (f-access, feature 04.)
 *
 * The rule: a user can access a project iff they have a `ProjectMember` row for
 * it. That row's `role` is the basis (`lead` | `member`). `Project.leadUserId`
 * is a denormalized pointer, NOT an access source — the "a project's lead also
 * has a `role='lead'` member row" invariant is established at project creation
 * (f-project-admin); membership is decided here from `ProjectMember` alone.
 *
 * Mirrors `lib/orchestration/access/conversation-access.ts`: a structured
 * result where **a non-member is reported identically to a non-existent
 * project** (`basis: null`) so callers translate both to a generic **404, never
 * 403** — distinguishing "not yours" from "doesn't exist" is a project-
 * enumeration vector. A member who lacks the *role* a `need` requires is a
 * different case: they can already see the project, so that is a legitimate
 * 403 (`basis` set, `ok` false). See `.context/app/planning/f-access.md`.
