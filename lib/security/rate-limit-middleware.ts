/**
 * Rate-Limit Middleware Dispatcher
 *
 * Consumed by `proxy.ts` at the project root (Next.js 16 renamed the
 * `middleware.ts` file convention to `proxy.ts`). Runs on every API request,
 * looks up the matching tier from {@link RATE_LIMIT_POLICY}, identifies the
 * caller, applies the section limiter, and returns a 429 response if the cap
 * is exceeded — otherwise yields control back to the route handler.
 *
 * Route handlers must NOT call section limiters themselves. They MAY call
 * tighter *per-flow* limiters (chatLimiter, audioLimiter, etc.) as additive
 * checks on expensive sub-flows.
 *
 * **Test bypass.** Setting `RATE_LIMIT_BYPASS=true` makes `applyRateLimit`
 * a no-op. `tests/setup.ts` sets this so the vast majority of unit tests
 * never have to think about rate-limiting. Tests that explicitly exercise
 * the middleware (or a section tier) unset the env var in their own
 * `beforeEach` and reset the limiter state per test.
 *
 * @see lib/security/rate-limit-policy.ts — the policy table this consumes
 * @see lib/security/rate-limit.ts — limiter primitives + the tier registry
 * @see proxy.ts — project-root Next.js wiring

/**
 * Apply the rate-limit policy to an incoming request.
 *
 * Returns a `Response` (status 429) when the cap is exceeded; the caller
 * MUST return that response immediately and skip further middleware /
 * handler execution. Returns `null` when the request is allowed to proceed.
 *
 * Order of operations:
 *   1. Bypass check (`RATE_LIMIT_BYPASS=true` env var, used by the test suite).
 *   2. Find the first matching policy rule. No match → no rate limit.
 *   3. Run the rule's `skip` predicate (if any). True → no rate limit.
 *   4. Build the rate-limit token via the rule's key strategy. Session
 *      resolution happens only for `'session-user'` rules and falls back
 *      to IP if there's no session.
 *   5. Check the section limiter for that token. Allowed → return `null`.
 *      Exceeded → return the standard 429 response with `Retry-After` and
 *      `X-RateLimit-*` headers.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *   - If session resolution throws (better-auth outage, DB down) we DO NOT
 *     fail-open: we fall back to IP keying so the request still gets a
 *     bucket. The route handler will surface the underlying error.
 *   - If the rule's tier isn't in `RATE_LIMIT_TIERS` (unreachable in
 *     practice — the type system enforces this) we treat it as "no limit"
 *     and log a warning. Open vs closed default here is open: a missing
 *     tier should not break production traffic, only telemetry.
