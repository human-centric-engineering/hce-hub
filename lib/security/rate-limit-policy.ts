/**
 * Rate-Limit Policy Table
 *
 * Single source of truth for which rate-limit tier applies to which API path.
 * Consumed by `lib/security/rate-limit-middleware.ts`, which runs from
 * `proxy.ts` at the project root on every API request (Next.js 16 renamed the
 * `middleware.ts` file convention to `proxy.ts`).
 *
 * **This is the canonical rate-limit configuration for Sunrise.** Reviewing
 * rate-limit policy = reviewing this one file. Adding a new section to the
 * admin surface, splitting a tier, raising a cap — all happen here, never in
 * route handlers.
 *
 * Route handlers do NOT call section limiters directly. The only acceptable
 * in-handler rate-limit call is an additive *per-flow* cap (e.g.
 * `chatLimiter`, `audioLimiter`, `imageLimiter` for the expensive chat-stream
 * flows). Those layer on top of the section tier applied by the middleware.
 *
 * @see lib/security/rate-limit-middleware.ts — the dispatcher that consumes this table
 * @see lib/security/rate-limit.ts — tier definitions and limiter instances
 * @see proxy.ts — project-root wiring

 * How the caller is identified when building the rate-limit token.

 * - `'ip'` — keyed on the client IP only. Use when the session can't (or
 *   shouldn't) be resolved at middleware time, e.g. authentication flows
 *   where the caller has no session yet, or webhook ingress where the source
 *   is identified by signature rather than session.
 * - `'session-user'` — keyed on the better-auth `session.user.id`. Falls back
 *   to IP if no session is present (the route handler will surface 401 if it
 *   requires auth — the rate-limit middleware doesn't enforce auth, it
 *   protects against abuse on top of whatever the route itself enforces).
 * - `'api-key'` — keyed on the API key hash from the `Authorization` header.
 *   Falls back to IP if no key. Used for routes that accept programmatic
 *   access via API keys instead of cookie sessions.
 * - `'embed-token'` — keyed on the embed token + client IP. Used for embedded
 *   widget surfaces where the caller is anonymous but the token identifies
 *   the embedding site.
