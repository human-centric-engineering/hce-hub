/**
 * Event → entity-payload-key map.
 *
 * Single source of truth for which payload field carries the agent or
 * workflow identifier for a given event type. The dispatcher uses this
 * to apply dimension-specific entity scoping on `AiWebhookSubscription`
 * rows (see `agentIds` / `workflowIds` columns).
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Absent map entry OR empty record  → event has no scopable entity,
 *     scoped subs match regardless of their filters.
 *   - `agent` key set                   → dispatcher reads payload[key]
 *     and intersects against the subscription's `agentIds` filter.
 *   - `workflow` key set                → same, for `workflowIds`.
 *   - Payload is missing the expected ID despite the event being mapped
 *     → fail-closed: a sub with a non-empty filter on that dimension
 *     does NOT match. Prevents an enrichment bug from leaking events
 *     to scoped subscribers.
 *
 * When adding a new wired event type, add a row here (or leave it out
 * if the event has no scopable entity). The `EVENT_ENTITY_KEYS_COVERS_ALL`
 * test asserts every entry in `WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES` has a deliberate
 * decision here.
